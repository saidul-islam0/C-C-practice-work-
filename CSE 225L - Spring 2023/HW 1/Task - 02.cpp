/*
Write a program that reads two integers a, b from the user and prints all perfect numbers between them.
You must write a user-defined function int isPerfect(int x) that determines if a number is perfect or not.
[Hint: A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the
number itself. For instance, 6 has divisors 1, 2 and 3, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6 is a perfect number.
